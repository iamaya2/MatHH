# MatHH: A Matlab-based Hyper-Heuristic framework
---
This repository contains a description of `MatHH`, a framework developed in Matlab for coding and testing hyper-heuristics.

## Required packages
In order to properly use `MatHH`, the following packages are required:

- `Utils`: a set of diverse utility functions to better organize the code; available at: [Github](https://github.com/iamaya2/Utils)

### File organization
Seeking to facilitate the maintenance of the required packages, the root folder of each package should be located at the same level. Hence, the following structure is suggested:

- `MatHH`
   - `src`   
- `Utils`
   - `distance`
   - ...
